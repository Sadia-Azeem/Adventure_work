## Methodology
1.	The project involved processing multiple Excel files containing raw business data. To ensure efficient data management and analysis, we followed a structured approach:
2.	Data Integration – All Excel files were stored in a designated folder and imported into Power BI using the folder connection method, enabling seamless data consolidation.
3.	Data Cleaning & Transformation – The imported data underwent thorough cleaning and transformation in Power BI's Power Query Editor. This included handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, standardizing formats, and applying necessary transformations to optimize the dataset for analysis.
4.	Data Modeling & Relationship Building – Relationships were established between tables based on primary and foreign keys to ensure accurate data connectivity and improve analytical capabilities.
5.	Measure Creation Using DAX – We leveraged Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create key performance measures such as total sales, profit margins, customer segmentation metrics, and sales growth trends, enabling deeper insights into business performance.
6.	Interactive Dashboard Development – A visually engaging and user-friendly interactive dashboard was designed in Power BI. The dashboard included key performance indicators (KPIs), trend analysis, and dynamic filters, allowing stakeholders to explore data from multiple perspectives.
7.	Performance Analysis & Insights Generation – The finalized dashboard provided an in-depth performance analysis, highlighting sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiencies to support data-driven decision-making.
This structured methodology ensured that the data was accurately processed, transformed, and visualized, delivering actionable insights to enhance business performance.
